This script will create a resource group, vnet, subnet, delegate the subnet, and create all the other necessary components to build a CMK NetApp volume. The script will run and determine location based on the current Azure cloud you are logged into (ie. Gov vs Commercial).  By default it will use usgovvirginia in Gov and eastus in Commercial. You may need to adjust the variables at the top of the script.
